# How to train the cat-translator model
This Python notebook demonstrates using Tensorflow to build and train a model that classifies images, called spectrograms, of cat vocalization:

# Demo of cat-translator sample app
**Note:** If you intend to build the sample app and run it for yourself, vewing the demo ruins the surprise!  But if you do not intend to build the app yourself, and are just curious about what it's like.. enjoy:
