*April, 2022: The cat translator project was part of a [2018 CASCON workshop](https://github.com/spackows/CASCON-2018_Analyzing_images).  Since then, the Watson Visual Recognition tool that was used in the workshop has been discontinued.  So the model-training notebook and web app have been updated to use Tensorflow instead.*

# How to train the cat-translator model
This Python notebook demonstrates using Tensorflow to build and train a model that classifies images, called spectrograms, of cat vocalization:

# How to create spectrograms
This Python notebook demonstrates how to generate spectrograms from sample recordings of a cat meowing:

# Sample cat-translator web app
The [cat-translator web app](https://github.com/spackows/CASCON-2018_Analyzing_images/tree/master/cat-translator/sample-app) puts the image classification model to work.  Watch this demo of the app in action:
